<h1>The Best Movies According to Alvaro</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>A Clokcwork Orange</h3>
<p>The craziness showcased in this film is something you do not see these days. The fact the film was released back in the 70s with such good effects makes it indeed my favorite one. Must watch if you like conspirancy and caothic stuff related to what the elite does not tell you.</p>

<h3>Super Mario Bross The Movie</h3>
<p>Peaches peaches peaches peaches oh I love you yeah!</p>

<h3>Spiderman</h3>
<p>Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker represented my at some point in my life.</p>
